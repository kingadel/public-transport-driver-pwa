# What is this?
This is a simple project to demonstrate how I code. This is part of a transportation platform I worked on.

## How to start?
I have removed all base urls from the project. So you can only check how the code is written or what libraries are being in used.  
Or you can add some mockup to the project and run it yourself. 

## Do I contribute?
Yes, probably. I try to add some mockup data to the project, so it will be fully functional. 


## Technologies used? 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
MUI. 
Hooks. 
Axios.
